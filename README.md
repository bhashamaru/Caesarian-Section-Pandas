Sample data:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/472/caesarian+section+classification+dataset

Data points I want to explore from this sample data:

Does chance of C section increase:
1. As age increases?
2. As number of delivery goes up?
3. If baby is a premie or a latecomer?
4. If blood pressure of mother at time of delivery is low/high?
5. If mother has a heart problem

Sample data:

Data points I want to explore from this sample data:

Does chance of C section increase:
1. As age increases?
   To explore age-related data, I grouped the sample data into mothers less than 30 years of age and mothers greater than or equal to 30 years of age. The less than 30 years of age group had lower chances of C-section as expected (55%) compared to mothers greater than or equal to 30 years of age (63%).
   
2. As number of delivery goes up?
   From this limited dataset of 80 women, I can conclude that chances of C-section increase as the number of deliveries that a mother has gone through increases.
   
3. If baby is a premie or a latecomer?
   65% of deliveries that were full term resulted in C section. 47% of deliveries that were either pre-term or post-term resulted in C section. Hence, this sample data set     does not prove my assumption that pre/post term deliveries lead to a higher chance of C section.
   
4. If blood pressure of mother at time of delivery is low/high?
   42% of deliveries resulted in a C-section when the blood pressure of the mother at the time of delivery was normal. Whereas 72% of deliveries resulted in a C-section when the blood pressure was either low or high. So we can conclude from this data sample that chances of C-section increases as blood pressure becomes abnormal.
   
5. If mother has a heart problem
   From this sample set of mothers having heart problems, I can conclude that chances of C-section is 80% when the mother has a heart problem vs only 44% when the mother has a healthy heart.
